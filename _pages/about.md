I am a **researcher in Microbiology** at the *Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases*, specializing in **Bioinformatics applications in Cellular and Molecular Biology**. My work focuses on uncovering connections between our genes, microbiota, and immune and nervous systems to reveal new insights for health improvement and disease prevention.

## ðŸ§¬ Research Themes

### ðŸ¦  Microbiome Analysis and Disease Modeling
- Investigating how gut microbes influence diseases, including **cancer**, **liver diseases**, and **neurodegenerative diseases**.
- Skills: Molecular assays, cell culture, bacterial assessment, Cloning, CRISPR/Cas9

### ðŸ’» Gene Expression Profiling and Computational Biology
- Utilizing bioinformatics techniques to explore molecular mechanisms in **gastrointestinal diseases**.
- Skills:	Genetic engineering, RNA-seq analysis, single-cell analysis, protein engineering, machine learning, databases and SQL for data sciences, python, NGS analysis

### ðŸ’Š Microbiome Therapeutics and Drug Delivery
- Developing models for microbiome-based therapies and studying **probiotic effects**, particularly on *Lactobacillus crispatus*.
- Skills: Protein engineering, probiotic engineering, fecal microbiota transplantation



## ðŸŽ“ Education
- Bachelorâ€™s Degree from **Alzahra University**
- Masterâ€™s Degree from **Azad Medical University of Tehran**

In addition to my lab work, I also teach **biology**, helping students explore the molecular and cellular complexities of life. My academic background spans microbiology, molecular biology, and computational biology, enabling me to approach research holistically with a focus on **personalized medicine**.
