I am a **researcher in Microbiology** at the *Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases*, specializing in **Cellular and Molecular Biology**. My research focuses on uncovering connections between our genes, microbiota, and immune and nervous systems.

## ðŸ§¬ Research Themes

### ðŸ¦  Microbiome Analysis and Disease Modeling
- Investigating how gut microbes influence diseases, including **liver diseases**, and **metabolic diseases**.
- Skills: Molecular assays, cell culture, bacterial assessment, Cloning, CRISPR/Cas9


### ðŸ’Š Microbiome Therapeutics
- Studying **probiotic effects**, particularly *Lactobacillus crispatus*.
- Skills: Protein engineering


<!-- 
## ðŸŽ“ Education
- Masterâ€™s Degree from **Azad Medical University of Tehran**
- Bachelorâ€™s Degree from **Alzahra University**

In addition to my lab work, I also teach **biology**, helping students explore the molecular and cellular complexities of life. My academic background spans microbiology, molecular biology, and computational biology, enabling me to approach research holistically with a focus on **personalized medicine**.
